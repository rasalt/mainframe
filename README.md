Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------
CDAP version 6.1.x or higher. 
  
Building Plugins
----------------
You get started with Mainframe reader plugins by building directly from the latest source code. However, you need to 
download the JRecord and cb2xml libraries from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jrecord/) and place them 
the ``repo`` directory before building the plugin. This is because these libraries are not yet available through the 
public maven repository at Maven Central. The plugin is currently tested with version 0.90.2 of the JRecord library, so 
please download that version. 

    $ git clone https://github.com/data-integrations/mainframe-reader.git
    $ cd mainframe-reader
    <Download and place the JRecord libraries in the repo/ directory>
    $ mvn clean package

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for the plugin under each ``target/`` directory.

Deploying Plugins
-----------------
You can deploy a plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact <target/plugin-jar> config-file <resources/plugin-config>

  > load artifact target/mainframe-reader-<version>.jar \
         config-file target/mainframe-reader-<version>.json

You can build without running tests: ``mvn clean install -DskipTests``

Mailing Lists
-------------
CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications or building plugins for appplications. You can expect questions from 
users, release announcements, and any other discussions that we think will be helpful 
to the users.
